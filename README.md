# Project

## Names
McKenzie Joyce, Farheen Rahman and Andrew Spencer
## Summary
The goal of our project is to develop our language, which we have named "Dothraki", using the files provided to us along with our own implemented features. This file outlines the roles each member will play, the deadlines we have decided for ourselves and the features that we have chosen to implement.
## Plan
We know that we need to use our previous homework files as a foundation for this project. Because we have all collaborated on the previous homeworks, we are able to understand each other's code pretty well. The main homework 10 that we will be using is McKenzie Joyce's. 

We think it's unproductive to have day-to-day deadlines, so we will be setting bi-weekly deadlines for this project. Two of these deadlines will be the ones that are already set by the TF's (4/23 and 4/29). By Friday, 4/26, we aim to have our evaluator completely finished. By Wednesday, 5/1, we are aiming to have 2/3 of our mix-in features completely functional. 

Again, we think it's unproductive to explicitly define roles in the team since we will all be collaborating on the code. Those mainly responsible for the evaluator will be Farheen and McKenzie. Andrew will be mostly responsible for parser and the exec file. Since we will all be learning how to check for the first time, we are all responsible for that file. 

Our preliminary interests for our optional add-ins include the infix function operator (5 points), additional support for lambdas and let expressions to take in multiple arguments (5pts each, 10 total), add case expressions for integers and bools (5pts), and finally import a file of definitions (10 points).
